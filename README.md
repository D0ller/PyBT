PyBT 2.0
========

Hackable Bluetooth stack written in Python
------------------------------------------

PyBT is a crappy half implementation of a Bluetooth stack in Python. At
the moment it only supports Bluetooth Smart (BLE).

PyBT emphasizes hackability over correctness. It mostly follows the
rules, unless you tell it not to.
